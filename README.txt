0) The modules will do ALMOST NOTHING without an NPR API key. Get one at http://api.npr.org
1) Download and install modules as usual.
2) npr_api does not do much by itself, unless you are writing your own (custom) module which depends on it
3) Set your API key at /admin/config/services/npr/api_config
4) npr_api_pull module will retrieve stories from the API:
  4a) either one at a time, at: /admin/content/npr
  4b) or automatically, via cron, at: /admin/config/services/npr/api_config
5) npr_push allows you to push locally created stories up into the NPR API. It requires a special API key + registration of your IP address with NPR (you can only push with that key, from that IP). Contact NPR Digital Services for more help: http://info.ds.npr.org/contact.html
